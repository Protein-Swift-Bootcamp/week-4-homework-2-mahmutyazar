## What's happening inside the app?

**You can search universities by countries with this app. You can also see music genres of TRT Radio.**

On the University Search screen, what you type on the textfield is being sent to next viewController and added at the end of university search API. Thus you can search universities by countries. If you want to see all universities around the world, just click search button without typing anything into textField.

On the Music screen, you will see the categories of TRT Radio that's coming directly from server.

Both pages have activity indicator that stops animating when data fetching process is over.
